# SLOTH Doc

## ***Intro***

Sloths on the Run is a Stable-NFT (sNFT) project. Essentially, each sNFT represents a Sloth that's done some pretty shady stuff in the Web3 world - rug-pulls, hacking, you name it.

Here's the twist: you can jailbreak any Sloth you want for a certain amount of money, then decide whether to keep him locked up or turn him in for a sweet bounty, which is the price for minting. 

In a crypto market that's going through a rough patch, we wanted to create something that goes against the grain. While other de-fi protocols and NFT projects make wild promises, we're all about changing the game for the better.

### *****************How It works!***************** 

The core idea is very simple. You can mint an sNFT just like how you can mint any other NFT. Let’s say you minted a Sloth for $10,000. Minting means you will ‘jailbreak’ the Sloth from prison.

You can use the Sloth as a present to a friend, as a payment to your colleague, or simply just as a way to show off on Twitter. Don’t ever worry about the price falling. 

Additionally, each Sloth has an encrypted invisible watermark. Anyone with Sloths mobile application can scan the Sloth, and the scanning will return the information about the Sloth. As it works even when printed, it also shows the possibility of the world’s first paper crypto! 

Just like how sloths are the most stable and non-moving animals on the planet, the price of the Sloth sNFT is guaranteed by protocol. If you are feeling guilty or need some cash at the moment, feel free to bring the Sloth sNFT back to the protocol and redeem your $10,000. 

### ***What We Built***

First, we built a web app where users can mint and redeem sNFTs. Also, users can send a Sloth sNFT with some tokens as well within the Web App. Let’s say you owe your friend $12,000. With one transaction you can send a $10,000 Sloth sNFT and $2000 USDT. The web app supports multiple chains, including Fuel Network.

Second, we also built a simple mobile application that can scan the invisible watermarks encoded in the Sloths for verification. It is capable of reading the invisible watermark in Sloth within 2 seconds or so. 

## ***The Future: After ETH Denver***

We will continue building and will launch a protocol. Of course, in crypto, there needs to be a profit model. The protocol will first earn a commission from minting, redeeming, and sending sNFTs. The commission gets distributed back to the holders in a decentralized manner every certain fixed time, such as a week. 

We wanted to fix the problem in conventional De-Fi 2.0 protocols that only early on-boarders make a profit while the ones who come in late lose everything. In our sNFT protocol, the interest an investor receives will depend on how much the total value of his sNFTs holds in the whole protocol pool, not when he comes in. 

In short, if the protocol’s TVL is $10M and you have $1M sNFT, you will be receiving 10% of the shared interest. If there was not a single transaction in the protocol during the week, then no interest for everyone. No complication, no scam. Furthermore, this means that the time entering the protocol has no effect whatsoever on the investor, and in fact, the last man standing will be the one to earn the biggest interest, since there will be massive interest from redemption commission! 

## Bounty Hunt
### *Build A Fullstack Dapp on Fuel* 

Sloths on the Run supports Fuel Network because of its UTXO-based design that is optimized for maximum scalability. This allows for parallel validation of transactions on consumer-grade hardware and eliminates the state bottleneck, as Fuel's unique fraud proof scheme doesn't require state serialization. Fuel's atomic swap feature also enables fast withdrawals for fungible assets such as ETH and ERC-20 tokens, providing a better user experience than the lengthy finalization delay for other types of withdrawals. Additionally, liquidity providers can offer liquidity for quick withdrawals without systemic risk if they fully validate Fuel blocks before accepting a swap.

Furthermore, Fuel Network doesn't require any special key formats or on-chain account registration, making it easy for users to deposit and withdraw funds from the platform. This is particularly useful for a stable NFT project like Sloths on the Run, as it allows users to quickly and easily manage their assets without having to worry about complex or time-consuming registration processes. Overall, Fuel Network's unique features make it an excellent choice for building a stable NFT project like Sloths on the Run, providing fast and efficient transactions that are critical for a successful and scalable project.

Overall, Fuel Network's permissionless and censorship-resistant nature, combined with its fast and low-cost transaction capabilities, make it an ideal chain for Sloths on the Run.
